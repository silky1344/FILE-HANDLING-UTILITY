# FILE-HANDLING-UTILITY
NAME- SILKY SHARMA
DOMAIN- JAVA PROGRAMMING
DURATION- 4 WEEKS
During my internship, one of the primary tasks assigned to me was the development of a File Handling Utility using the Java programming language. The goal of this task was to create a robust, reusable utility that could perform various file operations such as reading, writing, appending, copying, and deleting files. This utility would be used internally by the company for managing logs, configuration files, and data records more efficiently. I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my integrated development environment (IDE) due to its lightweight nature and strong support for Java through extensions like Java Extension Pack and Debugger for Java.One of the challenges I encountered during this task was managing exceptions effectively, particularly IOException, which frequently occurs in file-handling operations. To ensure robustness, I implemented comprehensive error handling and used try-with-resources blocks for managing file streams. This approach helped in automatically closing the streams and reducing the chances of resource leaks.The project was organized following object-oriented principles, where each operation was encapsulated into its own method inside a utility class called FileUtility. This modular approach not only improved code readability but also made it easier to test and debug individual functionalities. I also created a simple command-line interface (CLI) to demonstrate how users could interact with the utility by passing commands and file paths as arguments.I used Git for version control and created a GitHub repository to track the progress and share updates with my mentor. Throughout the project, I made several commits to document changes, experiments, and bug fixes. This habit not only kept the project organized but also helped in identifying and resolving issues quickly.By the end of the internship, I successfully delivered a functional File Handling Utility with documentation and sample use cases. This task helped me strengthen my understanding of Java I/O, exception handling, and clean code practices. It also enhanced my confidence in using VS Code for Java development and improved my ability to work independently on a real-world coding task.
